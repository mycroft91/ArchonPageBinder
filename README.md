This is a bot to create card pages from t2k5's card data(https://duelyststats.info/scripts/carddata/cardData.json) and [https://duelyststats.info/scripts/carddata/fullCardData.json].


Runs with python 2.7+


##Requirements:
 - mwclient

 - logging

 - time

##Details:
The **legacy** folder are scripts that are now obsolete.
The **utilites/** folder has the important routines. The **utilities/src/** folder has smaller pieces that you use to easily iterate over card data or login into wiki and create/edit pages. The credentials are **NOT** included in the repo. Please contact either mycroft92#9213 or Boronian#2002 on discord for the credentials.

##Misc:
 - I will try and update src/ modules whenever I can but please follow the coding guidelines so that it is easier for everyone to maintain.

 - Ideally it would really help if you can finish a utility script using the modules in the src folder. So that your module is not interfering with others' work.
